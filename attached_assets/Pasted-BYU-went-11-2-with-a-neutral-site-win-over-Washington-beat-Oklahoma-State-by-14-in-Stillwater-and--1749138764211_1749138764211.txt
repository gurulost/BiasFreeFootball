BYU went 11-2 with a neutral-site win over Washington, beat Oklahoma State by 14 in Stillwater, and finished #7 in SP+. They should not be outside the top fifty. That means something in the data pipeline, not the maths, is suppressing their edge weights.

Fast triage checklist
Verify schedule ingest
Open data/raw/games_2024.json (or your DB) and search for "BYU".
Make sure every BYU game has
correct home_team, away_team names (“BYU”)
conference = "Big 12"
season_type = "regular" or "postseason" not missing.
Check for FCS mis-tag
The collegefootballdata API sometimes tags BYU’s early-season opponent as “BYU-Hawaii” or leaves conference blank. If any BYU game is treated as FCS the risk / surprise multiplier can be crushed (FBS-vs-FCS damp).
Run the explain-edge helper
In a notebook:
from tools.debug import edge_breakdown
edge_breakdown("BYU", 2024).head(10)
This prints each BYU edge with its final weight and the factors applied.
Look for zero-ish or very small credits that shouldn’t be small.
Inspect conference-strength scaler
Confirm that in inject_conf_strength the multiplier for the Big 12 is around √(S/meanS) ≈ 1.05.
If it is well below 1, Stage-1 may still be under-rating the league; rerun Stage-1 printout.
Check BYU’s losses
BYU lost at Texas by 17 and to Kansas by 3. With the new mass-conserving penalty, those two edges carry sizeable weight against them. Make sure the margin cap (5) and risk exponent B (=1) are correct—otherwise the penalty side could still be harsher than intended.
Likely root-causes (ordered)
Bad ingested game rows – 95 % of “missing team” issues.
Conference mis-match – if BYU is still tagged “Independent” in a few rows it won’t pick up the Big 12 strength multiplier.
Incorrect home/away flag – a neutral-site win recorded as “home-favoured” can squash the venue factor.
Edge weight cap – if BYU blew out an FCS team by >50 and the margin cap was mis-set to 2 instead of 5, their base weight falls.
Fix path
Clean the raw BYU rows: normalise team name strings, set conference="Big 12" for every BYU row in 2024.
Re-run live pipeline for Week 15. BYU should jump roughly 30–40 spots; verify they land ~#18-#25.
