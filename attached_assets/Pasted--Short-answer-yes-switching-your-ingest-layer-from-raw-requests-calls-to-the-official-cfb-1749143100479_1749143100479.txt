**Short answer:** yes — switching your ingest layer from raw `requests` calls to the official **`cfbd-python`** client will cure most of the schema-drift headaches you’ve been fighting.  The package is an OpenAPI-generated wrapper that **pins the contract**, validates types, and lets you request season-specific data with one argument instead of hand-built URLs.

---

## Why the client helps

1. **Version pinning**
   The client is generated from a fixed OpenAPI spec.  When CFBD changes or adds
   fields the client bumps its pypi version; your `requirements.txt` lockfile
   protects you from silent schema drift.

2. **Season-aware helpers**
   `TeamsApi().get_fbs_teams(year=2024)` returns the 2024 alignment
   regardless of what year the server is currently on.  That eliminates the
   BYU‐independent / Texas-Big-12 mix-ups.

3. **Type validation out of the box**
   Each row is an instantiated model (`cfbd.models.Game`): if a field is
   missing you get an exception immediately, satisfying your “schema and type
   validation” checkpoint with zero extra code.

4. **Built-in paging / retries**
   The client transparently handles pagination and HTTP 429 back-offs; you
   won’t half-download a schedule.

5. **Single source for conference names**
   `ConferencesApi().get_conferences()` returns id + name in one call.  You no
   longer need to scrape IDs or maintain a YAML.

## Quick migration sketch

```bash
pip install cfbd-python==4.0.0   # pin the latest tested version
```

```python
from cfbd import ApiClient, Configuration
from cfbd.apis import TeamsApi, GamesApi, ConferencesApi

cfg = Configuration()
cfg.api_key['Authorization'] = os.getenv("CFBD_API_KEY")
cfg.api_key_prefix['Authorization'] = "Bearer"

with ApiClient(cfg) as api:
    teams   = {t.school: t for t in TeamsApi(api).get_fbs_teams(year=2024)}
    conf_id = {c.id: c.name for c in ConferencesApi(api).get_conferences()}

    games_raw = GamesApi(api).get_games(year=2024, season_type='both')
```

*Canonicalise*:

```python
def canonical_team(row_team):
    return teams[row_team].school      # already canonical

def team_conf(team):
    cid = teams[team].conference_id
    return conf_id.get(cid, "Independent")
```

After this, your ingest pipeline just iterates over `games_raw`, plugs in
`canonical_team` and `team_conf`, and writes to your cleaned CSV.  All earlier
validation code still runs, but missing-alias warnings should drop to zero.

---

## Things you still keep

* The checksum file and golden-file tests (client can still mis-serve data).
* The game-count and duplicate assertions.
* The canonical YAML **for historical seasons** prior to 2018 (CFBD data begin
  in earnest at 2014 but some early seasons lack conf\_id; keep the map for
  those).

---

## One-time tasks for the dev

1. **Add `cfbd-python` to `requirements.txt` / `poetry add cfbd-python`.**
2. **Replace raw `requests` calls with the client** in `src/ingest.py`.
3. **Update GitHub Action secret**: add `CFBD_API_KEY`.
4. **Delete manual alias placeholders** that are now redundant.
5. **Run full season replays** (2020-2024) to confirm BYU, Texas, Oklahoma,
   etc. all appear in their correct conferences and ranking anomalies vanish.

Once merged, the ingest layer will be future-proofed against endpoint changes
and conference realignment quirks, and your ranking math will only ever see
validated, season-correct rows.
