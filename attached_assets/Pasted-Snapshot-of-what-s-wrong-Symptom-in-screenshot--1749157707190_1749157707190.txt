Snapshot of what's wrong: 
| Symptom in screenshot                                                                                                                                                           | What it really means |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Top rating only ≈ 0.0096** (should be ≥ 0.013) → rating pie is spread over **> 134 nodes** or PageRank is renormalised twice.                                                 |                      |
| “**132 Teams**” at header  → we lost **2 FBS schools** during ingest.                                                                                                           |                      |
| **Miami-OH, Jax State, WKU, Colorado St in top 15** → risk/surprise multipliers are still exploding mid-major edges.                                                            |                      |
| **Army tagged “American Athletic”, Notre Dame “FBS Independents”, Boise “Mountain West”** (good) but **App State “Unknown” earlier** → conference map still missing edge cases. |                      |
| **Quality wins now populated** ✔, but check top teams for plausibility (Texas shows Georgia, Kentucky, Florida).                                                                |                      |

1. Guarantee we ingest exactly 134 FBS teams

Load authoritative roster first
fbs_teams = TeamsApi(api).get_fbs_teams(year=season, division='fbs')
FBS_IDS   = {t.id for t in fbs_teams}      # len must be 134
assert len(FBS_IDS) == 134, "missing or extra FBS teams"
Filter games in memory
games = [
    g for g in GamesApi(api).get_games(year=season, season_type='both')
    if g.home_team_id in FBS_IDS and g.away_team_id in FBS_IDS
]
Fail fast if any non-FBS row sneaks through:
bad = [g for g in games if g.home_team_id not in FBS_IDS or g.away_team_id not in FBS_IDS]
assert not bad, f"{len(bad)} non-FBS rows – API bug or filter off"
CI test
def test_team_count():
    assert len(ingest_games(2024).team_ids()) == 134
2. Stop accidental double-normalisation in PageRank

In pagerank.py we already normalise the adjacency matrix and then networkx
does its own row-normalisation again. Delete the pre-normalise:

# remove or comment this
M = A / A.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)
# just feed raw weighted adjacency into nx.pagerank
Top rating should jump ~40 % (0.009 → > 0.013).

4. Verify conference map completeness

After building TEAM_META:

missing_conf = [t for t in fbs_teams if t.conference is None]
assert not missing_conf, f"teams without conference: {missing_conf}"
Add any stragglers (e.g., transitional schools) to a manual_conf_overrides.yaml.

6. Quick sanity KPI after fixes

Metric	Target
len(teams)	134
Top rating	≥ 0.013
≥ 4 Power-5 teams rated ≥ 0.009	
BYU rank	top-25 if 10-2 season
No “Unknown” conf	0 rows
Add these as assertions in tests/test_integrity.py.
