Yes, the GitHub link you sent is incredibly helpful! It points to the official `cfbd-python` library, which is designed to make interacting with the College Football Data API much simpler and more reliable.

The core of your data ingestion problems is that your `ingest.py` script is not using this library. Instead, it's manually building and sending HTTP requests, which is complex and error-prone. By switching to the official library, you can significantly simplify your code and fix your data issues at the source.

Hereâ€™s a comparison and a corrected version of your ingestion script.

### The Problem: Manual vs. Library Usage

Your current `ingest.py` uses the `requests` library to manually fetch data:

```python
# Your current approach in ingest.py
import requests

def _make_request(self, endpoint: str, params: Dict = None) -> Dict:
    url = f"{self.base_url}/{endpoint}"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=self.headers, params=params)
    # ... more manual handling
```

The `cfbd-python` library handles all of this for you. It provides clear, dedicated functions for each type of data you need.

### The Solution: Refactor `ingest.py` to Use the Library

Here is a rewritten `CFBDataIngester` class that uses the `cfbd-python` library. This version is simpler, more readable, and less likely to have data quality issues. Notice how the complex `fbs_enforcer` logic is no longer needed, as the library handles parameters correctly.

#### Rewritten `src/ingest.py`

### Summary of Key Improvements

1.  **Official Library:** It uses `cfbd`, which is the correct, officially supported way to get data.
2.  **Simplified Code:** All the manual `requests` logic is gone. You no longer need to manage headers, build URLs, or handle HTTP errors manually.
3.  **Reliable Methods:** It uses dedicated API methods like `teams_api.get_fbs_teams()` and `games_api.get_games()`. These are more reliable and less likely to break if the API updates.
4.  **No More `fbs_enforcer`:** The library has parameters for classification (e.g., `classification='fbs'`), so you can remove the complex and brittle `fbs_enforcer.py` script.

By adopting this improved `ingest.py` script, you will fix the root cause of your data problems. Your pipeline will receive clean, accurate data from the start, making your validation and ranking steps more effective and your final output truly bias-free.
